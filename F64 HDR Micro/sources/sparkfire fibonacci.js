/*
  Sparkfire
  
  What happens when you allow a pattern like 'sparks' to heat the air around it?
  You get spark fire! It's probably a good idea to read through the comments on
  'sparks' first.

  Depending on the number of pixels in your strip, you may need to adjust the
  first few variables to your liking; While there's meant to
  mostly work depending on the number of pixels, you should tune them to look
  good on your setup.
